    Fixes a bug where Nova services won't recover after a temporary DB / MQ
    connection issue, when service group DB driver is used together with
    remote conductor, as the driver only handles RPC timeout errors and does
    not account for other types of errors (e.g. wrapped DB errors on the
    remote conductor transported over RPC)
